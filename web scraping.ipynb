It’s a great tool for teaching good coding practices and how to work with a team.

Instead, they will favor more of a \"guess-and-check\" approach to fixing bugs. While we don't encourage this approach at Rithm, we recognize that in the context of solving small, isolated problems, it can be successful. But when it comes to working on larger applications, professional engineers need a more sophisticated set of tools to fix problems.</p>\n",

      "<p>This process can be a positive experiment for many, but often, it can be challenging to be on the receiving end of a review. These can descend into demands for  needless uniformity of style (\"no! it's super-important to align your code <em>just so</em>\") or they can create uncomfortable or harmful power dynamics between peers about whose style or ideas are \"better.\" At their very worst, code reviews can merely provide cover for biased viewpoints or microaggressions directed toward developers who may have less power in organizations.</p>\n",
      "<p>While we recognize that not all parts of this practice are always helpful, we do encourage a lot of code reviews for our students here at Rithm. We think that, especially for newer developers in a class, these can provide useful feedback and lessons that can be difficult to get from lectures or books, and can also be hard to notice just from reading other code.</p>\n",

Her idea of a great party involves tabletop games, wine, and puns so cringe worthy that even your dad would groan. Kristen was able to take some time from her busy schedule to share more about her experience as a student, offer her advice for new students, and explain how the skills she learned at Rithm School will be used in her new position as a Software Engineer at Maven Technologies.</p>\n",
